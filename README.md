# STAT 240 - Biometrics I
Spring 2025  
Kansas State University

**Instructor:** Robert Sholl

**Course Coordinator:** Dr. Michael Higgins, Email: mikehiggins@ksu.edu

**Time:** 11:30 AM - 12:20 PM (M/W/F)

**Course Description:** A basic first course in probability and statistics with textbook, examples, and problems aimed toward the biological sciences. Frequency distributions, averages, measures of variation, probability, confidence intervals; tests of significance appropriate to binomial, multinomial, Poisson, and normal sampling; simple regression and correlation.

**Main Goal of this Course:** To builds students statistical literacy and introduce them to basic statistical analysis.

The first half of this course will focus on developing a baseline vocabulary for the science of Statistics, a fundamental understanding of statistical/mathematical notation, and performing basic measurement calculations.

The second half of this course will introduce simple concepts of Mathematical and Theoretical Statistics, and guide students through the process of performing the two most fundamental statistical analyses; regression and hypothesis testing.

**What this course is not:** A *mathematics* or *arthimetic* course. You will be asked to perform highly complex computations in this class, calculus (while a fundamental part of the science of Statistics) is not utilized, and your ability to perform accurate mental math will not determine your success. Understanding the concepts and equations introduced throughout the course will be the determining factor on whether or not you end this course successfully. 

**Prerequisites:** There are no formal prerequisites for this course, however it is **highly suggested** you have completed a high school algebra course before taking this class. If you lack that prerequisite, or feel incredibly shakey/rusty on those skills, we offer a "catch-up" course to help students understand enough algebra/math to succeed in this class. Details will be included closer to the semester.
