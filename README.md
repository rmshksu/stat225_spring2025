# STAT 240 - Biometrics I
Spring 2025  
Kansas State University

**Instructor:** Robert Sholl

**Course Coordinator:** Dr. Mike Higgins

**Time:** 11:30 AM - 12:20 PM

**Course Description:** A basic first course in probability and statistics; frequency distributions; averages and measures of variation; probability; simple confidence intervals and hypothesis tests appropriate to binomial and normal populations; if time permits, correlation and regression including confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for bivariate populations.

**Main Goal of this Course:** To builds students statistical literacy and introduce them to basic statistical analysis.

The first half of this course will focus on developing a baseline vocabulary for the science of Statistics, a fundamental understanding of statistical/mathematical notation, and performing basic measurement calculations.

The second half of this course will introduce simple concepts of Mathematical and Theoretical Statistics, and guide students through the process of performing the two most fundamental statistical analyses; regression and hypothesis testing.

**What this course is not:** A *mathematics* or *arthimetic* course. You will be asked to perform highly complex computations in this class, calculus (while a fundamental part of the science of Statistics) is not utilized, and your ability to perform accurate mental math will not determine your success. Understanding the concepts and equations introduced throughout the course will be the determining factor on whether or not you end this course successfully. 

There was previously a section of this course on Excel. That has been removed, so this course will not require Excel competencies. 

**Prerequisites:** There are no formal prerequisites for this course, however it is **highly suggested** you have completed a high school algebra course before taking this class. If you lack that prerequisite, or feel incredibly shakey/rusty on those skills, we offer a "catch-up" course to help students understand enough algebra/math to succeed in this class. Details will be included closer to the semester.
