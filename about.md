# About

This course covers the most fundamental topics in the science of Statistics and Probability. We'll discuss everything from descriptive vocabulary and methods of data visualization, to theoretical statistics and statistical analyses. 

My primary goal for my students is to increase your *understanding* and *literacy* with the concepts in Statistics to **arm you with knowledge for the real world**. While this class is a foundational and extremely important course for the sciences, it's more important that you capture the information that you would use *every day of your lives*. 

As such ***I hold very high standards for your understanding of interpretations and concepts***, while I hold lower standards on mathematical rigor than most instructors in the field. 

My secondary goal is to ensure that ***if you attend class every day*** you will not have to study more than 2 hours per week outside of class (inclusive of homework time) to succeed in the class. 

**Main Goal of this Course:** 

To builds students statistical literacy and introduce them to basic statistical analysis.

The first half of this course will focus on developing a baseline vocabulary for the science of Statistics, a fundamental understanding of statistical/mathematical notation, and performing basic measurement calculations.

The second half of this course will introduce simple concepts of Mathematical and Theoretical Statistics, and guide students through the process of performing the two most fundamental statistical analyses; regression and hypothesis testing.

**Prerequisites:** There are no formal prerequisites for this course, however it is **highly suggested** you have completed a high school algebra course before taking this class. If you lack that prerequisite, or feel incredibly shakey/rusty on those skills, we offer a "catch-up" course to help students understand enough algebra/math to succeed in this class. Details will be included closer to the semester.

## Grading

The course will be for 3 credits, graded on an A-F scale. A (>90%), B (90%-80%), C (80%-70%), D (70%-60%), and F (<60%). Final grade will be based on the following criteria:

* Exam 1 - 20%

* Exam 2 - 20%

* Homework - 20%

* Final Exam - 30%

* Attendance - 10%

### Attendance  

Attendance to lecture and in-class participation are completely optional, but highly recommended. If you're late or need to leave early, you are only asked to be respectful and not be disruptive. I would rather you be in class at all than be class on-time or stay for the full duration. 

### Attendance Credit/Question of the Day

5% of extra credit will be given out for attendance, determined through participation and submission of individual practice problems for each day of class.

These problems are **not graded**, simply counted for participation and assigned the full points. 

These will be scored these as they are submitted, based off of level of understanding. **This is purely for data collection and will never reflect on you negatively or positively.** They simply provide a persistent understanding of the classes competency level, so that instruction can be adjusted as needed.

Periodically, I will take a student's work they submitted for an attendance problem and convert it into digital writing to make it completely anonymous. I may or may not change their work slightly to add to the anonymity. The class will be asked to submit a score and a single piece of feedback on the work the student has done. That will count as your attendance for the **entire week**. 

After **every 2 chapters** in our course schedule are completed, I will release a set of practice problems that can be used as a "make-up" attendance. We cover 10 chapters total in this course, so you have ***5 "completely excused" abscences***. 

### Homework


Late homework will not be accepted. It is up to instructor discretion if an extension is provided.

### Homework Corrections

For all homework assignments in the course, students are allowed to submit corrections of their work ***for each problem completed for less than full points.*** Incomplete questions will not be offered the opportunity to be corrected. 

Corrections provide ***100% points back.*** Submissions will ***only be accepted through the Canvas assignment***. 

For the entire homework assignment, per question you wish to correct, provide the following:

1. Why you got the answer wrong (i.e., I mistook a qualitative variable for a quantitative variable, so I described it as an Interval variable as a result)
2. Why that answer is wrong (i.e., the variable describes a ranking of salespeople at Amazon, which is not a quantification of salespeople nor is it an interval where 0 doesn't reflect absence of something)
3. What the correct answer is (i.e., the variable is Qualitative and Ordinal)
4. Why it's the correct answer (i.e., a numeric ranking is a categorization of something so it is qualitative and it has a natural ordering where 1 is above 2 so it is ordinal)

## General Policies

## Generative AI policy  
The University has yet to release a comprehensive AI policy. Thanks to that, I get to define my own.

I cannot stop any student from using Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), or Generative AI. However if I suspect you are using one of these tools to **replace knowledge work** I will doll out the most egregious punishment any instructor can use: ***I will make you do the work again.*** If you truly believe you can circumvent my methods of detection, please refer to the "About" page of my academic website. 

AI related tools are ***tools***. Please recognize that they are something ***you should be competent with***, and I will ***gladly*** help you understand their myriad of use-cases in and outside of this class. Do not use them to ***replace knowledge work***, and if you're unsure whether the action you're doing qualifies as that, please reach out to me directly and just ask. 

## Academic Honesty (Gracefully Plagarized from the University Code of Conduct)

Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System (www.ksu.edu/honor). The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled. A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.

## Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities  

Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.  If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441.

## Expectations for Classroom Conduct  

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Government Association By Laws, Article VI, Section 3, number 2. Students that engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.


## Copyright Notification  

During this course, students are prohibited from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm, or posting lecture notes on any websites without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course.
