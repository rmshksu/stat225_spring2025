Welcome to Introduction to Statistics!

Take the time to read through the [About](https://rmshksu.github.io/stat225_spring2025/about/) page to review the general Syllabus.

Familarize yourself with the layout of the website, specifically the [Lectures](https://rmshksu.github.io/stat225_spring2025/calendar/) page. Each week has two links, (exception of this week and exam weeks), that will take you to the lecture for the day.

All of the lecture content for the semester is pre-posted, feel free to check it out if you want. Exam review content will be posted closer to exam dates so it can be more personalized to the class.
