Welcome to Biometrics!

Take the time to read through the [About](https://rmshksu.github.io/stat225_spring2025/about/) page to review the general Syllabus.

Familarize yourself with the layout of the website, specifically the [Lectures](https://rmshksu.github.io/stat225_spring2025/calendar/) page. Each week will have hyperlinks associated with each day that will take you to the lecture for the day.

You'll notice that not all of the weeks are posted currently. This will change rather rapidly, so just keep an eye out. You'll always have your lectures for the week.

If you ever click a hyperlink *that's ahead of our current lecture week*, and it leads nowhere, thats intentional. If that happens for a current lecture week, contact me ***immediately***.
